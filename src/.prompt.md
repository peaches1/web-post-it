Implement the following UI enhancements for the notes system:

1. Header Styling:
   - Add a darker background color to note headers
   - Make headers distinct from note content
   - Ensure headers remain visible when note is collapsed

2. Interactive Behavior:
   - Enable double-click on headers to toggle note visibility
   - When collapsed, hide the note content while keeping header visible
   - When expanded, display full note content

3. State Indicator:
   - Add a toggle icon in the top-right corner of each note header
   - Use "▼" for expanded state
   - Use "▶" for collapsed state
   - Icon should update automatically with note state

4. Typography:
   - Reduce overall font size for better readability
   - Apply bold styling to the first line of each note
   - Maintain consistent padding and spacing

5. Visual Hierarchy:
   - Ensure clear visual separation between header and content
   - Maintain consistent spacing between notes
   - Preserve alignment and structure when toggling states

The implementation should follow accessibility best practices and maintain a clean, professional appearance.
